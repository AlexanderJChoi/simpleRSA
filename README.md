#RSA Encryption
This repository is simply an implementation of the RSA algorithm.

##Origin
The RSA Algorithm was first described by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman while at MIT. It is used for secure data transmission.

##Overview
RSA employs a public-key/private-key system, in which each user has both a public key - which is accessible by any person - and a private key - which only the person knows. The public key is used to encrypt data before is is sent, and the private key is used to decrypt the information once it reaches its destination.
